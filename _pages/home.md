Welcome! I am currently a postdoc at the [Center for Cognitive Science of Language at the University of Nova Gorica](https://www.ung.si/en/research/center-for-cognitive-science-of-language/). I graduated from the [Department of Linguistics at New York University](https://as.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/as/departments/linguistics/homepage.html). My advisor was [Maria Gouskova](http://gouskova.com/).

My primary research interest is the study of _gradient_ and _variable_ patterns in two domains: 
1. The organization of _morphological paradigms_. Specifically, I investigate how speakers use information about one inflected form of a lexical item to determine other inflected forms of the same lexical item).
2. Properties of _pronominal clitics_, in particular their relative ordering and their behavior in embedded infinitival clauses.

I work primarily on Czech and Slovenian, and secondarily on Hungarian, Russian, and English.

My name is pronounced [gaɪ təˈbætʃnɪk].
