From 2013 to 2017, I visited [Every Public Transit Stop in Prague](https://everypublictransitstopinprague.tumblr.com/).

With [Emma Claire Foley](https://emmaclairefoley.com/), I wrote a [profile](https://ingeveb.org/blog/long-lunches-at-cafe-jerusalem) of Cafe Jerusalem, the best Jewish restaurant in Lviv, Ukraine for In geveb.

I am a poor but improving accordion player.
