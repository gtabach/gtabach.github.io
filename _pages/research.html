  <em>This dissertation investigates morphological dependencies: correlations between two lexically specific patterns, such as selection of inflectional affixes. Previous work has established that such correlations exist in the lexicon of morphologically rich languages (Ackerman et al., 2009; Wurzel, 1989), but has not systematically tested whether speakers productively extend these patterns to novel words. I present a series of corpus and nonce word studies&mdash;in Hungarian, Czech, and Russian&mdash;testing whether speakers vary their selection of suffixed forms of novel words based on the forms of that word that are presented to them. In all three cases, speakers vary their responses in accordance with the provided stimuli, demonstrating that they have learned and productively apply morphological dependencies from the lexicon.<br>
  I present a theoretical account of morphological dependencies that can account for my experimental results, based on the sublexicon model of phonological learning (Allen &amp; Becker, 2015; Becker &amp; Gouskova, 2016; Gouskova et al., 2015). In this model, speakers index lexically specific behavior with diacritic features attached to underlying forms in lexical entries, and learn generalizations over sublexicons defined as words that share a feature. These generalizations are stored as constraints in phonotactic grammars for each sublexicon, enabling speakers to learn phonological and morphological dependencies predicting words that pattern together. This model provides a unified treatment of morphological dependencies and generalizations that are phonological in nature. My studies show a wide range of learned effects, not limited to those that follow an organizational principle like paradigm uniformity. The sublexicon model assumes that speakers can learn arbitrary generalizations without restrictions, giving it needed flexibility over more restrictive models which rely on notions of morphophonological naturalness.</em>

  <em>Some English verbs use distinct forms for the preterite (e.g. </em>I <strong>broke</strong> the door<em>) and the past participle (e.g. </em>I&rsquo;ve <strong>broken</strong> the door<em>). These verbs may variably show use of the preterite form in place of the participle (e.g. </em>I&rsquo;ve <strong>broke</strong> the door<em>), which we call <u>participle leveling</u>. This paper contributes the first detailed variationist study of participle leveling by investigating the phenomenon in perfect constructions using data collected from three corpora of conversational speech: two of American English and one of British English. A striking degree of similarity is found between the three corpora in both the linguistic and the extralinguistic constraints on variation. Constraints on participle leveling include tense of the perfect construction, verb frequency, and phonological similarity between preterite and participle forms. The variable is stable in real time and socially stratified. The paper relates the findings to theoretical linguistic treatments of the variation, and to questions of its origin and spread in Englishes transatlantically.</em>

  <em>Theories of morphology must account for lexicalized variation: lexical items that differ unpredictably in their inflection must be memorized individually and differ in their stored representation. When tested on such cases, adult speakers usually follow the &ldquo;law of frequency matching&rdquo; (Hayes et al. 2009), extending gradient phonological patterns from the lexicon. This paper looks at lexicalized variation in the Hungarian possessive: first, I show that a noun&rsquo;s choice of possessive is partially predicted by its plural form as well as its phonological shape. Then, using a novel nonce word paradigm, I show that Hungarian speakers productively apply this cooccurrence pattern between the plural and possessive. I treat lexicalized variation as indexed by diacritic features marking lexical entries and propose that Hungarian speakers have learned a gradient cooccurrence relation between diacritic features indexing their plural and possessive forms, extending the sublexicon model of Gouskova et al. (2015). This approach also allows for a flexible analysis of inflection classes in languages like Russian as emergent clusters of frequently cooccurring features.</em>

  <em>This paper examines restrictions on the ability of Czech second-position clitics to climb out of embedded clauses. Clitics cannot climb out of CP phases, but can climb out of infinitives without CP phase boundaries, even those with syntactic subject PRO. Clitics cluster together in a set order, and while arguments of a single verb can freely rearrange themselves to match the required order, an argument of an embedded infinitive generally cannot climb over the controller in the matrix clause in object control constructions. I propose that clitic movement is due to a DP probe that comes equipped with a hierarchy of case features, and that clitics reached by the probe out of order with respect to the hierarchy are trapped and cannot cliticize. Arguments may freely scramble within a single TP, allowing arbitrary reordering, but embedded arguments cannot scramble over matrix arguments, leading to the restrictions in object control sentences.</em>

  <em>Ackerman et al. (2009) and Ackerman and Malouf (2013) argue that the organization of morphological systems allows speakers to efficiently solve the Paradigm Cell Filling Problem: how to predict a word&rsquo;s inflected form given some of its other forms. For example, a given word&rsquo;s possessive suffix in Hungarian can be predicted in part by its phonology and by its exponent in forms like the plural. I propose a model in which this phonological and morphological predictability is encoded in formal, constraint-based grammars. In particular, I extend the sublexicon model (Gouskova et al., 2015), in which lexically specific behavior is handled using diacritics on lexical items. Thus, I treat the Paradigm Cell Filling Problem as a problem of finding correlations between diacritics in a given lexical entry, without relying on the storage of a paradigm&rsquo;s output forms.</em>

  <em>Myler (2017) proposes an algorithm for root-outward cyclic Spell-Out (Bobaljik, 2000) where the order in which heads are spelled out may deviate from their linear order when phrasal movement within the phonological word causes a mismatch between this linear order and the syntactic hierarchy (so-called Mirror Principle violations). Myler uses this method to account for cases where a morphophonological process applies across an intervening morpheme. I extend his model to morphosyntactically conditioned contextual allomorphy in Hungarian possessive DPs. Myler&rsquo;s algorithm allows us to preserve strict locality, where only adjacent morphosyntactic nodes may condition contextual allomorphy (Embick, 2010).</em>
